## Notes for Backend Developers

1. **City Parameter**: The `city` parameter comes from the URL path and should match the city slug format (e.g., "hyderabad", "new-york", "los-angeles"). The backend should filter virtual offices based on this city parameter.

2. **City-Based Filtering**: When a city is selected in the SecondaryNav component, users navigate to `/virtual-office/{city-slug}`. The backend API should return only virtual offices available in that specific city.

3. **Empty Results**: If no virtual offices exist for a city, return an empty array `[]` in the `data` field. The frontend will automatically display the ComingSoon component.

4. **City Name Format**: The city slug in the URL (e.g., "new-york") should be converted to the proper city name format (e.g., "New York") for display purposes. The backend can return the city name in the response if needed.

2. **Rating**: Should be a decimal number between 0 and 5, typically displayed with one decimal place (e.g., 4.2).

3. **Price Format**: Prices should include currency symbol and time period (e.g., "₹999 /month", "$99 /month").

4. **Features Array**: Should contain 2-4 key features that highlight the virtual office's main benefits.

5. **Services Array**: Should contain 3-5 services with their respective pricing. These are displayed as a list in the card.

6. **Badge**: Optional field. If not provided or null, no badge will be displayed.

7. **Pagination**: Standard pagination structure should be included in the response.

8. **Error Handling**: Return appropriate HTTP status codes:
   - `200` - Success
   - `400` - Bad Request (invalid city parameter)
   - `404` - Not Found (no virtual offices for the city)
   - `500` - Internal Server Error

## Frontend Implementation

The frontend displays virtual offices in a responsive grid layout:
- Mobile: 1 column (cards stack vertically)
- Desktop: 2 columns per row

Each card displays in horizontal layout:
- **Left side**: Image (40% width on desktop)
- **Right side**: Content (60% width on desktop)
  - Office name and rating
  - Location
  - Features as badges
  - Services with pricing in a list
  - "Get Quote" button

The hero section includes a booking form that can be submitted separately to a booking endpoint.

### Card Layout Details

- Cards use a horizontal flex layout on desktop
- Image takes 2/5 width, content takes 3/5 width
- On mobile, cards stack vertically (image on top, content below)
- Badge appears as overlay on the top-right corner of the image
- "Get Quote" button is positioned at the bottom of the content area
